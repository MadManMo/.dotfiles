My Arch setup. Idk if it constitutes as a rice but I like most of how it looks. Trying to get it all prety seemless.
Im sure I could use something like base16 to uniformly theme it but ill get to that when I get to that.
For now this is here for when something breaks or I want o kinda clone it to somewhere else. Feel free to take what you like
and or tell me a better way to do something. I will eventually figure a way to give this an easy install script.
For now I'm content with just using it like this. I never claimed to be good with this stuff.
